# Assignment Evaluation Scripts

Welcome to the "scripts" directory, designed to assist both teachers and students in evaluating assignment submissions. This directory contains scripts that enable self-evaluation of assignments by students and facilitate teacher-led assessment.  
Teachers can use this directory to provide correct evaluation scripts for students and conduct their assessments.

## Getting Started

To utilize the evaluation scripts, follow the steps below:

### Clone the Repository

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.

```bash
cd path/to/your/desired/directory
```
3. Clone the repository using the following command:
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```
